"This is already explained partly in 2.15. Any operation like
A = A^3/A^2, will yield a different interval than the original A.

How do we fix this? One way is to do algebraic reduction of the
expression before doing any interval arithmetic.

Are there some better ways? I am very interested to hear. The
usual literature (wikipedia et al) seem to be mum on these
important issues."
