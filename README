* A note on section 2.2.4

2.2.4 describes Henderson's picture language. I have implemented this as a
separate namespace. under the 'pictlang' directory. To use this, load the
namespaces and do:

> (show painter frame)

where painter is the procedure representing the picture and frame is the
frame on which you want to draw it.

TODO:

1. make it a lein project.
2. scan non-programming exercise/solutions and put it as jpg/pdfs.
