* A note on section 2.2.4

2.2.4 describes Henderson's picture language. I have implemented this as a
separate namespace. under the 'pictlang' directory. To use this, load the
namespaces and do:

> (show painter frame)

where painter is the procedure representing the picture and frame is the
frame on which you want to draw it. An example is the 'wave' painter
defined in the pictlang.pictures namespace.

> (show wave (make-frame (make-vect 0 0)
                         (make-vect 1 0)
                         (make-vect 0 1)))

The implementation was directly inspired and influenced by the one in the
JVM based Scheme implementation called JAKLD.
